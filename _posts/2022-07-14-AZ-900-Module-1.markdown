### Understanding the Azure Core Concepts
-------------------------------------

Lets start with a 45-minute part to understand [Core Azure Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/alearn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/)

This part will help learners understand,

*   Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
*   Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery
*   Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups
*   Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones

[Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/introduction), will walk you through cloud computing fundamentals, azure fundamentals and domain areas for AZ 900 preparation.

The next unit will walk you through about what is [Cloud computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing)

The next two units provide information about [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-microsoft-azure) and [Azure Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/tour-of-azure-services) and guide you to create your own [Azure Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/get-started-with-azure-accounts)

The next unit of the module introduces a [case study](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/case-study-introduction) of [Tailwind Traders](https://www.tailwindtraders.com/) to help understand requirements for cloud and will be used throughout the course to map the concepts to Azure resources. 

The module finishes with a [Knowledge Check](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/knowledge-check) and [Summary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/summary) of things learned.

Hope you find the resources useful for getting started with your AZ 900 preparation. 

Happy Learning!
