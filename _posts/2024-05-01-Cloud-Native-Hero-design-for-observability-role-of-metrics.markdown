# Design for Observability - Role of Metrics

In the previous [introductory](https://cloudnativehero.github.io/cloud-native-hero-design-for-observability-001) article we looked at the basics of **observability** and its pillars that contribute to the platform. In this and the some of the next articles, lets look at them in bit detail. Let's look at the role of Metrics in Observability.

Metrics form the foundation of observability by offering quantitative insights into the inner workings of complex systems, enabling teams to effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their performance. It plays a crucial role in the understanding various aspects of systems such as system health, resource utilization, error rates, throughput, latency, and many other key indicators.

In an observability platform, metrics contributes with,

 - **Monitoring System Health**, by providing real-time insights into its various components and their performance.
 - **Capacity Planning**, by providing information about resource utilization trends, helping teams anticipate when additional resources might be needed.
 - **Root Cause Analysis**, by aiding in the investigation and identification of the root causes behind failures or performance degradation with the valuable forensic data
 - **Visualization and Alerting**, through dashboards and used to trigger alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded, allowing for proactive monitoring and intervention.
 - **Detecting Anomalies**, by analyzing metrics over time, defining **Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** to represent the reliability and performance goals of a system and **Continuous Improvement** with the ability to measure the impact of changes and optimizations made to the system.

While metrics play a crucial role in observability by providing quantitative data about the performance and behavior of a system, effective use of metrics in an observability platform involves some **best practices** to ensure that the data collected is meaningful, actionable, and scalable,

- **Define Clear Objectives**, with the understanding of what you want to achieve with the metrics you collect.
- **Choose Metrics that are relevant** to your system's performance, reliability, and business objectives. Avoid collecting unnecessary data that may add noise without providing valuable insights.
- **Use Standardized Metrics** and naming conventions to ensure consistency and ease of interpretation across different teams and systems.
- **Instrumentation**, throughout your system to collect metrics at various layers (e.g., infrastructure, application, user experience) and comprehensive coverage and visibility into system behavior.
- **Granularity** of metrics at an appropriate level. Too much granularity can lead to overwhelming volumes of data, while too little may obscure important insights. Adjust granularity based on the specific needs of your system.
- **Aggregation and Retention Policies** to help manage data volumes efficiently and retaining data based on importance and storage constraints.
- **Visualization**, to create informative dashboards that enable easy interpretation of metrics data. Visualizations should be clear, concise, and tailored to the needs of different stakeholders.
- **Correlation**, from different sources (e.g., logs, traces, and metrics) to gain deeper insights into system behavior and performance. It also helps identify relationships and dependencies between different components.
- **Document** the meaning and context of each metric to ensure that stakeholders understand their significance and regular **communication and collaboration** among teams responsible for monitoring and analyzing metrics data.
- **Periodic Review and Iteration** of your metrics strategy to ensure that it aligns with evolving business needs and system requirements. Iterate and refine your approach based on feedback and insights gained from metrics analysis.

By adhering to these best practices, organizations can leverage metrics effectively within their observability platforms to gain actionable insights, improve system reliability, and drive business value. We will look at some of the strategies for getting the metrics and challenges associated with it in the next article.
