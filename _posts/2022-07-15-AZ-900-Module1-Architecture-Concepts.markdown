If you are interested in the cloud, but aren't sure what it can do for you? In this module, you'll learn about the advantages of using cloud computing services, and you'll learn to differentiate between the categories and types of cloud computing. Lets have a look at this 25-min module for [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/).

[Unit 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/introduction), will continue with the Tailwind Traders case study and introduces you to the learning objectives in the module.

[Unit 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/types-of-cloud-computing), will discuss different types of cloud models, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud.

[Unit 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/benefits-of-cloud-computing), will describe and discuss benefits of cloud and different considerations for moving to cloud.

In the following [module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/) you'll examine the various concepts, resources, and terminology that are necessary to work with Azure architecture. You will learn about Azure subscriptions and management groups, resource groups and Azure Resource Manager, as well as Azure regions and availability zones.
