# Design for Observability - Introduction

**Observability** is a fundamental concept in various fields such as engineering, computer science, and systems theory. It refers to the **ability to understand the internal state of a system solely through its outputs**, allowing for effective **monitoring**, **troubleshooting**, and **optimization**. In complex systems, especially those involving software, networks, or large-scale infrastructure, observability plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability, performance, and maintainability.



In the context of modern software development and system architecture, observability has become increasingly important as systems have grown more complex and distributed. The ability to observe and understand the behaviour of these systems in real-time is critical for ensuring their reliability, diagnosing issues, and optimizing performance.

Following are the primary components to observability platform:

**Metrics**: Metrics are quantitative measurements that provide insights into the performance, health, and behaviour of a system. These could include things like response times, error rates, CPU usage, or any other relevant data points that help us understand how the system is performing.

**Logs**: Logs are records of events or activities that occur within a system. They provide a detailed chronological history of what has happened, including any errors or exceptions that occurred, user actions, system events, and more. Logs are invaluable for troubleshooting issues and understanding the sequence of events that led to a particular outcome.

**Traces**: Traces are records of the flow of a specific request or transaction as it moves through a distributed system. They capture information about how the request traverses different components or services, including any network calls, database queries, or other interactions. Traces help us understand the end-to-end behaviour of a system and identify performance bottlenecks or issues with specific components.

**Events**: Most modern distributed systems have the capability to generate events either themselves or with the help of orchestrator / cloud platform. This helps to create a trail or feed into other modules like Alerting or create custom metrics.

**Alerts**: Monitoring all of your infrastructure in one place wouldn’t be complete without the ability to know when critical changes are occurring. Having an alerting mechanism to create the alerts and send notifications is an important part of the observability platform.



To achieve observability, systems need to be properly instrumented with tools and techniques that collect and analyze metrics, logs, and traces. This often involves incorporating monitoring tools, logging frameworks, distributed tracing systems, and other observability solutions into the architecture of the system. By embracing observability principles and investing in the right tools and practices, organizations can gain valuable insights into the behaviour of their systems, enabling them to detect and diagnose issues quickly, optimize performance, and ultimately deliver better experiences for their users.
